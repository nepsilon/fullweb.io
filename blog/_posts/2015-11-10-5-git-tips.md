5 tips to show (once again) that Git is amazing:

{% highlight shell %}

# Fetch a file from another branch
# without changing your current branch
git checkout other_branch -- path/to/file 

# See what branches are merged
git checkout master 
git branch --merged
# Use --no-merged to see the branches
# not yet merged

# Have Git auto-correct you
git config --global help.autocorrect 1
# Example:
git commti 
WARNING: You called a Git command named 'commti', which does not exist. 
Continuing under the assumption that you meant 'commit' 

# Show word changes in diff
git diff --word-diff 

# Set remote branch tracking by default
git config --global push.default tracking

{% endhighlight %}
