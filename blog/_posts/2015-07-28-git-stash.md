Ever started working on the wrong branch with Git? Use stash!

{% highlight shell %}

# Use stash to detach unstaged changes
git stash

# Change branch
git checkout my-branch

# Retrieve your changes as you left them
git stash pop

# stash can do much more, see its options
git stash help

{% endhighlight %}
